We find that this lesson site is pedagogically very effective when used as 
lecture notes and learning activity instructions. We do not recommend lecturing 
with a screen share of the lesson site or projection of the lesson site.
This combination of text, activity prompts, and verbal narration tends to exceed effective
cognitive loads for learners.

But this lesson works best with slides that include 1) photos from the production
of the Du Bois charts and the Paris World Expo, and 2) examples of Du Bois charts.
We provide these images within the lesson site so that you can open them in separate
browser tabs for display while you lecture. 

Alternatively, you can copy and modify [this Google Slides deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1mVh4c4bYjM5DDp6ix33fo1ZYS8NE15QdKYOUB1lx7H4/edit?slide=id.g2f60d06f563_0_22#slide=id.g2f60d06f563_0_22) with all of the images for this episode.

Subsequent episodes will have links to separate Google Slide Decks with their 
images.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: questions 

- How can data visualization and creativity help answer important scientific questions?
- Why did data visualization become predominant in the social sciences earlier than for physical and natural sciences?
- How did Du Bubois use data visualization to challenge false biological theories of racial inequality?
- How did team science help Du Bois' team to create impactful visualizations for the 1900 Paris exposition?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: objectives
Understand which of the four chart types used by Du Bois and contemporary scientists are best suited for different types of data and multivariate analyses.

Interpret how Du Bois used one of these chart types for an analysis that contradicted false, biologically-based theories of racial inequality.

Identify best practices for making charts accessible and engaging for broad audiences that are either present or missing from a Du Bois chart.

Ground your ability to to read and understand STEM charts by hand drawing a chart.


::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
In this section we will explore charts developed for the 1900 Paris Exposition by  Du Bois and his collaborators, as examples
of effective analysis and storytelling.

We will examine types of data and the various chart types in some detail.

## Chart Types

We use different types of graphs based on the types of data and relationships we are analyzing. Du Bois used variants of most of the major graph types that are still used today: (pie, bar, line charts, and statistical maps).

You can also explore more complex adaptations of these charts using the [Du Bois Resources repository for this lesson:] 
 (https://github.com/HigherEdData/Du-Bois-STEM)

The types include the fanciful Du Bois spiral, stacked bar graphs, and integrated photographs.

### Chart Types: Pie Charts

![fanchart](files/fanchart.jpg)

Pie graphs illustrate the
percentages of categories (like
occupations) within a larger
unit (like a population) where
all the percentages add up to
100%.

This analyzes a
one-dimensional distribution
across one categorical
variable.

### Chart Types: Bar Charts

![barchart](files/barchart.jpg)

Bar graphs compare
frequencies or percentages of
one category (like literacy)
among other categories (like
race or nation).

This helps us analyze
two-dimensional
relationships, typically
between *two categorical
variables.*

### Chart Types: Line Charts

![linechart](files/linechart.jpg)

Line graphs plot frequencies or
percentages of a continuous
interval-ratio variable (like total
population) on a y-axis among
categories represented by
different lines (like racial groups)
over a third category of another
ordinal or interval ratio variable
on an x-axis (like year).

This analyzes three dimensional
relationships between *three
different variables, including
interval ratio variables.*

Time series line graphs, with
time on the x-axis, are the
most common type of line
graph.

### Chart Types: Statistical Maps

![maps](files/statmap.jpg)

Statistical maps graph
geo-spatial distributions of
continuous interval-ratio
variables (like the Black
population of the U.S.).

This allows us to graph a
multi-dimensional
relationship including
two-dimensional spatial
locations.

## Design Aesthetics and Accessibility

While Du Bois sought to make his visualizations accessible to broad
audiences, advances in universal design practices do even more to
make visualizations accessible to people with diverse visual,
cognitive, auditory, or motor strengths and needs. Practices include:

* Keeping visuals as simple as possible, presenting only
information necessary for analysis.

* Color-blind friendly use of color and contrast, avoiding
over-reliance on color

* Alternative text (alt text) that screen readers can use to provide
an audio description of images.

* Descriptive titles and labels
* Offering both visual and non-visual formats

* Including narrative text with context and summaries

## Exploring Charts: a worked example

[Illiteracy of American Negroes compared with that of other nations: Paris Exposition, 1900](https://github.com/ajstarks/dubois-data-portraits/blob/master/plate14/data.csv)

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge

![barchart](files/barchart.jpg)


### Exercise 1

What type of graph is this?

 * What variables are plotted on the chart?
 * Are the variables categorical, ordinal, or interval / ratio?
 * What statistics are plotted?
 * Which elements are highlighted


::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: hint

How does Black illiteracy (the red bar) compare with other countries

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: solution

![barchart](files/barchart.jpg)


### Solution 1
 * What variables are plotted: Country, Illiteracy rate
 * Variable types :ordinal
 * Statistics plotted: Illitercy rate, (percent illiterate, by country, ordered highest to lowest)

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: discussion

### Disucssion

* How does Black illiteracy
compare to literacy in other
countries on the chart?

* What is similar about the
countries with higher illiteracy
than Black illiteracy in the US?

## Design Aesthetics and Accessibility

![barchart](files/barchart.jpg)


What makes this graph easy or
difficult to understand?

How is the graph aesthetically
appealing? How could could it be
more appealing?

How does this graph take its
audience into consideration?

What tools would you need to create
this graph by hand?

This visual, a conventional bar graph,
uses spot color to highlight the data
for Black Americans compared to
other countries, showing the
illiteracy rate to be at the midpoint
compared to other nations.

The chart portion is a large
percentage of the canvas, simply
showing the message.

Note the bilingual labels and titles (a
nod to the venue and audience).


## Context and Data Story

Du Bois presented his graph for illiteracy among Black Americans and other
nations (left), together with the graph of Black illiteracy in Georgia from 1865
to 1900. What data story do these 2 graphs tell together?

# Example: Re-Create with Modern Data and Accessible Design

![mod-data-chart](files/mod-data-chart.png)

Activity: Hand draw a recreation of
Du Bois’ graph using the data below
on college attainment today.

Building on the graph to the left,
what accessible design
improvements can you make?

Data: 

```
Country		College

Russia		60
Ireland		54
Sweden		49
France		42

```


::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints 

- Even simple chart types can convey interesting meaning. Color man be used to emphasize points
