We find that this lesson site is pedagogically very effective when used as 
lecture notes and learning activity instructions. We do not recommend lecturing 
with a screen share of the lesson site or projection of the lesson site.
This combination of text, activity prompts, and verbal narration tends to exceed effective
cognitive loads for learners.

But this lesson works best with slides that include 1) photos from the production
of the Du Bois charts and the Paris World Expo, and 2) examples of Du Bois charts.
We provide these images within the lesson site so that you can open them in separate
browser tabs for display while you lecture. 

Alternatively, you can copy and modify [this Google Slides deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1mVh4c4bYjM5DDp6ix33fo1ZYS8NE15QdKYOUB1lx7H4/edit?slide=id.g2f60d06f563_0_22#slide=id.g2f60d06f563_0_22) with all of the images for this episode.

Subsequent episodes will have links to separate Google Slide Decks with their 
images.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: questions 

- How can data visualization and creativity help answer important scientific questions?
- Why did data visualization become predominant in the social sciences earlier than for physical and natural sciences?
- How did Du Bubois use data visualization to challenge false biological theories of racial inequality?
- How did team science help Du Bois' team to create impactful visualizations for the 1900 Paris exposition?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: objectives
Understand which of the four chart types used by Du Bois and contemporary scientists are best suited for different types of data and multivariate analyses.

Interpret how Du Bois used one of these chart types for an analysis that contradicted false, biologically-based theories of racial inequality.

Identify best practices for making charts accessible and engaging for broad audiences that are either present or missing from a Du Bois chart.

Ground your ability to to read and understand STEM charts by hand drawing a chart.


::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
In this section we will explore charts developed for the 1900 Paris Exposition by  Du Bois and his collaborators, as examples
of effective analysis and storytelling.

We will examine types of data and the various chart types in some detail.

## Chart Types

We use different types of graphs based on the types of data and relationships we are analyzing. Du Bois used variants of most of the major graph types that are still used today: (pie, bar, line charts, and statistical maps).

You can also explore more complex adaptations of these charts using the [Du Bois Resources repository for this lesson:] 
 (https://github.com/HigherEdData/Du-Bois-STEM)

The types include the fanciful Du Bois spiral, stacked bar graphs, and integrated photographs.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge

### Exercise 1
Why do you think Du Bois created a series of graphs and data visualizations of Black life for the exposition?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: hint

Why visualizations instead of a written report?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: solution

### Solution 1
Du Bois used rigorous yet accessible methods to challenge subsequently discredited claims associated with scientific racism that devalued and assumed Black communities as inferior. The visualizations helped show some of the systemic barriers impeding the progress for black Americans as compared to a deficit approach that would suggest black people were somehow innately less capable. This is a paradigm shift in showing how social science can work together with other STEM fields to produce the most accurate science and impressive visualizations.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: discussion

### Disucssion
What effect did the venue have on the design of the visuals?
